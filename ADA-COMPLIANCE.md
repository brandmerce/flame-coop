---

## 2. WCAG Criteria Addressed

### Perceivable

| Criterion | Requirement | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1.1.1 Non-text Content | All images have text alternatives | All `<Image>` components include descriptive `alt` attributes. Decorative SVGs use `aria-hidden="true"`. |
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Semantic HTML conveys structure | Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6), semantic elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`), table `scope="col"` attributes. |
| 1.4.1 Use of Color | Color is not the only indicator | Links in high-contrast mode receive underlines. Focus indicators use outline (not color alone). Badge labels include `aria-label` for screen readers. |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large | All text tokens updated: `--text` 15.5:1, `--text-mid` 9.7:1, `--text-light` 5.9:1, `--gold-text` 4.5:1 on white. Footer text opacity raised from .3-.45 to .55+. |
| 1.4.4 Resize Text | Page usable at 200% zoom | Fluid typography with `clamp()`. High-contrast mode bumps base font 20% (18px to 21.6px). |
| 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) | 7:1 enhanced contrast | High-contrast mode provides 7:1+ ratios for all text: `--text` #111 (19:1), `--text-mid` #333 (12.6:1), `--gold-text` #6B5D2F (7.1:1). |
| 1.4.12 Text Spacing | No loss of content with increased spacing | High-contrast mode increases `letter-spacing: 0.04em`, `word-spacing: 0.08em`, `line-height: 2.0`. |

### Operable

| Criterion | Requirement | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | All functionality via keyboard | All interactive elements are keyboard-accessible. Focus trap in mobile menu. Escape key closes menus/modals. |
| 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | Skip navigation link | `<a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">` is the first focusable element on every page. Hidden off-screen, visible on focus. |
| 2.4.3 Focus Order | Logical tab order | DOM order matches visual order. Modal focus management returns focus to trigger on close. |
| 2.4.7 Focus Visible | Visible focus indicator | `2px solid var(--gold)` outline on all focusable elements via `:focus-visible`. High-contrast mode uses 3px blue outline. |
| 2.5.5 Target Size | 44x44px minimum touch targets | All buttons, links, and interactive elements meet 44px minimum. Navigation toggle is 44px. Social links have `min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px`. Accessibility widget button is 48px. |

### Understandable

| Criterion | Requirement | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 3.1.1 Language of Page | `lang` attribute on `<html>` | Set via Next.js `<html lang="en">` in root layout. |
| 3.2.1 On Focus | No unexpected context change | No auto-redirects or popups on focus. |
| 3.3.1 Error Identification | Form errors identified | Admissions form (Eduweby iframe) handles its own validation. |

### Robust

| Criterion | Requirement | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | All UI components have accessible names | `aria-label` on navigation elements, `aria-expanded` on toggles, `role="dialog"` on modals, `aria-disabled="true"` on placeholder links. |

## 3. Changes by Component

### Global (styles/globals.css)

- **Contrast tokens:** All `--text-*` CSS custom properties updated to meet 4.5:1 minimum. Added `--gold-text: #85733D` for gold text on light backgrounds.

- **Reduced motion:** `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables all animations and transitions.

## 4. High-Contrast Mode

An opt-in accessibility widget is available on every page (bottom-right corner). When activated:

- Adds `.a11y-mode` class to `<html>`
- All text contrast ratios increase to 7:1+ (WCAG AAA)
- Base font size increases 20% (18px to 21.6px)
- Letter spacing and line height increase for readability
- Links receive underlines (not relying on color alone)
- Focus indicators thicken to 3px blue outline
- Footer and dark-section text goes to full opacity
- Buttons switch to high-contrast black/white scheme
- User preference persists across sessions via `localStorage`

---

## 5. Testing Recommendations

- **Screen reader testing:** VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), NVDA (Windows), TalkBack (Android)
- **Keyboard-only navigation:** Tab through all pages; verify skip link, focus trap in mobile menu, modal focus management
- **Zoom testing:** Verify layout at 200% browser zoom
- **Color contrast:** Use browser DevTools accessibility panel or axe DevTools extension
- **Reduced motion:** Enable "Reduce motion" in OS settings; verify no animations play
- **High-contrast mode:** Toggle the accessibility widget; verify all text remains readable

---

## 6. Known Limitations

- **Eduweby iframe form:** The admissions/request-info form is a cross-origin iframe from Eduweby. Internal accessibility of the iframe content is controlled by Eduweby and cannot be modified by The Flame's codebase.
- **CMS-driven content:** Content editors should follow accessibility best practices when adding content through Sanity (e.g., providing alt text for images, using proper heading hierarchy in rich text).

---

## 7. Applicable Laws

- **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):** Title III requires places of public accommodation to provide accessible web content. Courts have increasingly applied ADA requirements to websites.
- **Section 508 (Rehabilitation Act):** Applies to federally funded programs. WCAG 2.0 AA is the referenced standard.
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA:** The internationally recognized standard for web accessibility. Meeting AA satisfies ADA and Section 508 requirements.

This site targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across all pages and components.
