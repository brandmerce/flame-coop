                  <p>The Flame started the way most Spirit-led things do — not with a business plan, but with a burden.</p>
                  <p>A small group of homeschool families in the St. Augustine area shared a growing conviction: their children needed a community where faith wasn&apos;t something tacked onto the school day. It needed to be the school day. So they built one.</p>
                  <p>The founding team brought together a licensed speech-language pathologist, a curriculum specialist and certified teacher, a licensed mental health counselor, spiritual counselors, and homeschooling mothers. Every program they built carries that fingerprint — grounded, developmental, and driven by the Word.</p>

                    The name wasn&apos;t accidental. 2 Timothy 1:6 — &ldquo;fan into flame the gift of God.&rdquo; That&apos;s the whole mission, right there.
