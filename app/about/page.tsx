                  <p>The founding team brought together a licensed speech-language pathologist, a curriculum specialist and certified teacher, a licensed mental health counselor, spiritual counselors, and homeschooling mothers. Every program they built carries that fingerprint — grounded, developmental, and driven by the Word.</p>
