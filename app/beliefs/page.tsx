                    We don&apos;t separate faith from learning — we never have. When children discover how the natural world works, we point to the God who designed it. When they study history, we trace the faithfulness and sovereignty of God through it. When they learn to read, write, reason, and debate, we believe they&apos;re being equipped to carry truth into the world.
