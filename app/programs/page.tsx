  { name: 'Sparks',       level: 'Kindergarten', ages: 'Ages 5–6',   theme: 'The First Spark',             description: "Play-based, warm, and full of wonder. Children build early phonics, number sense, listening skills, and social confidence while being introduced to God as Creator and Father. This stage is joyful by design — because first impressions of learning should be good ones." },
  { name: 'Embers',       level: 'Level 1',      ages: 'Ages 6–8',   theme: 'Who Is God the Creator?',     description: 'Rooted in the Old Testament, Embers students begin to understand God as Creator, Provider, Covenant-keeper, and faithful Father. Every lesson returns to the same question: Who made this, and what does it tell us about Him?' },
  { name: 'Illuminators', level: 'Level 2',      ages: 'Ages 8–10',  theme: 'How Do We Walk With Christ?', description: "Illuminators discover Jesus through the Gospels — His life, His teachings, His love, His call to follow. The light of Christ starts becoming personal. Students aren't just learning about Jesus anymore; they're learning what it means to walk with Him." },
  { name: 'Firestarters', level: 'Level 3',      ages: 'Ages 10–12', theme: 'Encountering the Holy Spirit', description: 'Firestarters explore the early church and the Spirit moving through ordinary people who said yes. Identity in Christ takes root. Leadership begins to emerge. Students start to see that the same Spirit who moved in Scripture is still moving today.' },

  { badgeLabel: 'DI',   name: 'Discipleship I',   level: 'Middle School', ages: 'Ages 12–14', theme: 'Biblical Truth in a Secular World',  description: "Students examine the foundations of Biblical Truth alongside the messages they hear from the world — through Socratic discussion, debate, writing, and introductory apologetics. They begin moving from inherited faith to owned faith. They learn to ask hard questions, reason clearly, and stand on God's Word with humility and courage." },
  { badgeLabel: 'DII',  name: 'Discipleship II',  level: 'Upper Middle',  ages: 'Ages 14–16', theme: "Discerning God's Voice",              description: "Building on Discipleship I, students go deeper — learning to recognize God's voice, strengthen their walk with Christ under pressure, and engage culture with grace and conviction. Advanced rhetoric, writing, and reasoning sharpen both faith and mind. This level prepares students to live out their faith in a world that won't always understand it." },
  { badgeLabel: 'DIII', name: 'Discipleship III', level: 'High School',   ages: 'Ages 16+',   theme: 'Ready for the World',                 description: "Discipleship III is where formation becomes real-life readiness. Students learn to know who they are in Christ, articulate and defend what they believe, and apply Biblical Truth to the decisions and pressures that come after high school. Designed to complement dual enrollment — giving students the spiritual and intellectual formation to carry their faith confidently into college, work, ministry, and adult life." },

  { name: 'Bible & Spiritual Development', desc: "Every day is grounded in a biblical worldview. Students move through the Old Testament, the Gospels, the early church, and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit — one level at a time, building on what came before." },
  { name: 'Math',                          desc: "Using the Saxon Math Program, students receive guided small-group instruction plus real-life application. Math isn't a worksheet here — it's a window into the order and beauty of what God made." },
  { name: 'Reading & Language Arts',       desc: "We use the Orton-Gillingham multisensory approach — one of the most effective reading models available. Students build strong foundations in reading, writing, spelling, and comprehension. Upper levels tackle full novels, annotation, and literary analysis." },
  { name: 'Science, History, Music & Art', desc: "Interdisciplinary units built around a central theme — connecting subjects across learning styles. Students don't just read about things. They build them, discuss them, and ask real questions about them." },
  { name: 'Grammar & Writing',             desc: "Grammar is discovered, not memorized. Writing is taught as a skill worth mastering — students learn to organize their thoughts, support an argument, and say exactly what they mean." },
